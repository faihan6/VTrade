# appliances

This is the development name for VTrade app. The name will be changed during release.

The app is being developed in flutter. The app is still in development state.

## Current Status and things to be done
 -> The image_picker library and general File management has been tested only for Android. Should test the same for iOS.
 
 -> The app hasn't been linked to cloud database yet.
 
 -> A seperate route(this is how we call page in flutter) has to be created for admins to validate the product.
 
 -> Only the validated product should be shown to buyers. Currently no validation is there and the user can see every product uploaded by sellers.
 
 -> Search feature and notification alert feature hasn't been implemeted yet.
